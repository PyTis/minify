I have pulled code from a script called CSSMIN to perform the CSS minification.

  `cssmin` - A Python port of the YUI CSS compressor.
  
  This was taken from:
  =================================================
    http://github.com/zacharyvoase/cssmin

      version          = '0.2.0',
      author           = "Zachary Voase",
      author_email     = "zacharyvoase@me.com",
      description      = "A Python port of the YUI CSS compression algorithm."
  =================================================
This program also utilizes rjsmin, however this module needs to be installed
(for now).
  =================================================
    rjsmin was created by Andr√© Malo and can be found here:
